# Decisions

Architectural decisions with rationale and provenance, newest first. Entry format: date, decision, why, source. When a decision is reversed, mark the old entry **Superseded** with a pointer — don't delete it; the rationale trail is the point.

**Hygiene note:** this file is past the KB's ~150-line guideline (`kb/INDEX.md`) — due a split (e.g. by year, or into `decisions.md` + `decisions-archive.md`) in a future `/harness-audit` or dedicated session, not blocking here.

## 2026-07-20 — `work-issue` commits feature code, review fixes, and the KB update as three separate commits

**Decision:** `work-issue`'s old combined "Ship" step (commit feature code including any review fixes, then commit the KB update separately) is split into three steps — Commit (feature code, before review runs), Review (`/code-review`, its fixes committed separately), Pay back (`/kb write`, committed separately) — landing three distinct commits per PR instead of two.
**Why:** Committing the feature code only at Ship time meant `/code-review` ran against an uncommitted diff and its fixes were silently folded into the same commit as the original implementation — the PR history couldn't show what review actually changed. Committing before review makes the fix commit a visible, separate diff.

## 2026-07-20 — A React-state-derived signal module's enter/exit lives in one `useEffect`, not scattered across every setter of that state

**Decision:** `editModeSignals`' `activeEditTrackId` (spec 004 milestone 2, #490) is entered/exited from a single `useEffect` in `Workstation.tsx` keyed on `activeSheet`, not from each individual handler that can change `activeSheet` (`toggleMixer`, `toggleLyrics`, `toggleEffects`, `toggleRecording`, the drawer's own close button).
**Why:** an earlier version called `enterEditMode`/`exitEditMode` only from the effects-drawer's own open/close handler. Switching sheets via a *different* toggle (e.g. clicking "Show mixer" while the effects drawer was open) changed `activeSheet` without going through that handler, leaving `activeEditTrackId` stale — `Timeline` kept rendering every track as `--edit-background` with no drawer open and no active track. The same gap meant the signal was never cleared on unmount either (project navigation remounts `Workstation`, resetting its `useState` but not the module-level signal), leaking a stale, now-nonexistent track ID into the next project. A `useEffect(() => { if (open) enter(); return () => exit(); }, [activeSheet])` fixes both: its cleanup fires on every `activeSheet` transition *and* on unmount, so no call site needs to remember to call `exitEditMode()` itself. Caught by three independent code-review angles (removed-behavior, altitude, cross-file tracer) converging on the same bug before it shipped.
**Source:** Issue #490 (spec 004 milestone 2).

## 2026-07-20 — Pinch integration: abort an already-armed scrub via a reducer event, not just gate entry; touchcancel joins touchend

**Decision:** `useScrubberScroll.ts`'s `handlePointerMove` checks `isPinchingRef.current` *before* the `scrubStateRef !== 'idle'`/pointer-count gates, and — if a gesture is already active — dispatches a new `scrubGesture.ts` event (`pinchStarted`, resolves to `idle` from any state) rather than silently returning. This cancels the pending debounced seek and, if the gesture had already paused playback, resumes it. Separately, `useTimelineZoom.ts` now listens for `touchcancel` alongside `touchend`, both resetting `isPinchingRef.current = false`.
**Why:** #474's pointer-count gate (gesture entry requires exactly one active pointer) already covers a pinch whose two touches land together — the only case CDP's `pinchTimeline` e2e helper can simulate, so those tests passed before this issue's wiring even landed. It does *not* cover a pinch starting **mid-drag**: a resting finger already past the movement threshold (paused, resume armed) before a second finger joins. Gating pinch suppression only on the pointer-count/idle checks — the initial, "belt-and-suspenders" version of this fix — left that armed scrub to ride to its debounced seek, seeking against scroll math a mid-gesture zoom had just changed. Confirmed unreachable-in-practice for the simultaneous-start case (traced pointerDownPosRef nulling) but load-bearing for the mid-drag one — both by independent code-review agents in the same session, then verified by a red-then-green unit test (`Scrubber.test.tsx`) that fails without the reorder. The `touchcancel` gap is the same missing-cancel-event class that caused the original stutter loop (mechanism 1, #472) — before this diff `isPinchingRef` had no observable effect if stuck, so it was latent; wiring it into the scrub controller made a stuck-true value actively harmful (permanently blocks single-finger scrubbing), also caught red-then-green.
**Source:** Issue #476 (spec 002 milestone 4).

## 2026-07-20 — `window.__mawimbi` dev-only e2e verification bridge

**Decision:** `AudioService`'s constructor sets `window.__mawimbi = { spectrogramCache }` when `import.meta.env.DEV`; the shape is declared in `src/global.d.ts`. e2e tests read worker-produced state (e.g. transcribed melody notes) directly through it instead of reverse-engineering a DOM/pixel proxy for a data claim.
**Why:** Milestone 1 of spec 003 (#480) needed to prove "a known note exists at a known time" after real Basic Pitch transcription. The candidates were screenshot-decoding the piano-roll overlay's paint (fragile: the overlay draws on the same canvas as the already-colorful spectrogram content, under a 3D tilt transform, so isolating "melody-note pixels" from "spectrogram pixels" would require reimplementing the renderer's coordinate math in the test) or a direct read. `kb/verification.md`'s own hierarchy prefers a direct state read for a data claim — the bridge is that, just reachable through `page.evaluate` instead of a plain getter. Scoped minimally (only `spectrogramCache`, not the whole `AudioService`) and DEV-only, so it never exists on deployed builds — e2e always runs against `npm start` per `playwright.config.ts`, so DEV-gating alone (no `?query` escape hatch, unlike `?tune`) is sufficient.
**Source:** Issue #480 (spec 003 milestone 1).

## 2026-07-20 — PlaybackService command epoch bumps only on real transitions, not guarded no-ops

**Decision:** `PlaybackService.commandEpoch` (issue #475: lets the scrub controller cancel an armed auto-resume if an explicit command intervenes during the debounce window) is bumped inside `play()`/`pause()`/`stop()` only on the branch where a real state transition happens, after their early-return guards — not unconditionally at the top of the method. `rewind()`/`seekTo()` have no such guard and keep bumping unconditionally, since every call to them is a real command regardless of prior state.
**Why:** `play()`/`pause()` are also invoked as incidental cleanup by `RecordingService`/`workstationEffects.ts` (count-in cancellation, overdub start/stop) while playback may already be in the target state. `isActivelyRecording()` is false during count-in ('armed' state) — only true once actually 'recording' — so scrubbing isn't gated off during count-in, making it reachable for a scrub's armed resume to overlap with one of these incidental calls. Bumping the epoch on a guarded no-op there would spuriously cancel a resume that had nothing to do with the intervening call. Caught by three independent code-review angles (removed-behavior, cross-file trace, altitude) converging on the same bug before it shipped, in the same session that introduced the epoch.
**Source:** Issue #475.

## 2026-07-20 — Gesture entry requires exactly one active pointer; end-of-timeline compares raw numbers, never toFixed(1) strings

**Decision:** `useScrubberScroll.ts`'s gesture-entry threshold check (issue #474) only fires with exactly one pointer down; a second pointer joining clears the tracked origin. `PlaybackService.isAtEndOfTimeline()` compares `transportTime >= totalTime` directly, never `toFixed(1)` string equality.
**Why:** A two-finger pinch's `touchmove` handler calling `preventDefault()` suppresses the native *scroll* the browser would otherwise generate, but not the parallel `pointermove` events per finger — each still fires and can cross a movement threshold on its own, so any pointermove-driven gesture check must explicitly gate on pointer count or a pinch misreads as a one-finger drag. Separately, `"10.06".toFixed(1)` → `"10.1"`, never `"10.0"` — a frame that steps over the 0.1s rounding bucket makes string-equality end-of-timeline detection miss the end entirely; the raw numeric `>=` has no such gap. Both found by code review during #474's implementation, before either shipped.
**Source:** Issue #474 (spec 002 milestone 2), PR #498.

## 2026-07-19 — Stub Node-only transitive ML dependencies

**Decision:** `package.json` `overrides` maps `onnxruntime-node` and `sharp` to an in-repo empty package.
**Why:** the packages are dead weight (all inference is in-browser), and a *local* stub — rather than a registry "empty package" — keeps third parties out of the supply chain. Sizes, recovery-speed rationale, and the runtime failure-mode gotcha: CLAUDE.md, "Stubbed Node-only dependencies".
**Source:** PR #466.

## 2026-07-19 — Runway is a pure transform stage; PhantomScroller is the only scroll container

**Decision:** No scroll container inside the tilted plane; scroll position is applied as a `translateY` offset stage, and spectrogram canvases are positioned imperatively in the draw rAF loop.
**Why:** Scroll clipping happens in pre-transform layout space, so a scrolling tilted plane clipped everything at/above the playhead before the transform could project it into view — while rect-based tests kept passing. Also removes tilt-side `scrollTop` clamping (#450) by construction.
**Source:** Issue #459, PR #464.

## 2026-07-18 — Solve runway geometry in JS, accept one-frame resize lag

**Decision:** Timeline padding and all runway transforms come from `runwayProjection.solveGeometry()` in JS, replacing pure-CSS `cqh`/custom-property mechanisms.
**Why:** The layout→screen mapping is nonlinear under perspective; CSS `calc()` cannot express the inverse projection, and the linear approximation drifted whenever tilt + open drawer combined. Cost: padding lags one frame behind *continuous* native resize (tracked as #453 — accepted tradeoff, not a regression to revert).
**Source:** Issues #443, #445, #453; PR #452.

## 2026-07-18 — Edge rails instead of fog on the runway

**Decision:** Atmospheric fog gradient removed in favor of glowing rails along the timeline edges, rendered as CSS pseudo-elements so the existing `rotateX` projects them.
**Why:** Fog sat behind the playhead's frequency-bar overlay and read as mud; rails match the Beat Saber-style reference art. Fog is deliberately not coming back (scope note on #446). Fog's *first* life was PR #397, removed in #410 — #454 was already a second attempt.
**Source:** PRs #454 (fog reintroduced), #456 (replaced by rails).

## 2026-07-18 — Dev-only tuning overlay instead of tune-by-PR

**Decision:** Visual tuning of the runway happens through a live slider overlay (dev builds / `?tune`), which serializes the result as a `runwayConfig.ts` snippet.
**Why:** Six consecutive PRs had shipped just to adjust single parameters; a feedback loop measured in seconds replaces one measured in deploys.
**Source:** Issue #447, PR #455.

## 2026-07-18 — Tap-to-seek rejected; seeking is drag-only

**Decision:** Tapping the runway toggles playback; seeking happens only by dragging the flat, untransformed PhantomScroller.
**Why:** Inverse-transform tap seeking (`DOMMatrix.inverse()`) would add screen→plane remapping for a gesture drag already covers. `runwayProjection.screenYToPlane` stays as the general inverse projection, exercised only by round-trip tests — don't delete it as "unused", don't re-propose tap-to-seek.
**Source:** Issue #403 (closed not-planned).

## 2026-03-16 — PhantomScroller: a native scroll surface, not a JS touch proxy

**Decision:** Scrolling is owned by an invisible, untransformed overlay that is a real native scroll container.
**Why:** The 3D tilt shrinks the transformed container's hit-test area to a narrow trapezoid, breaking native touch scrolling. A JS pointer-capture touch proxy (#419) shipped and was replaced one day later: the phantom gets wheel/touch/momentum physics for free and deleted the proxy plus dead-zone wheel forwarding. Precursor of the 2026-07-19 only-scroll-container rule.
**Source:** PRs #419, #420.

## 2026-03-15 — Package-by-feature reorg

**Decision:** `src/` reorganized from package-by-layer (`services/`, `hooks/`, `components/`…) to package-by-feature (207 files moved), layout-only.
**Why:** Understanding one feature required searching several top-level directories; `ls src/features/<x>` now shows everything — navigability for agents as much as humans. Public APIs, signal ownership, and the bridge-hook pattern were deliberately unchanged.
**Source:** PR #415.

## 2026-03-15 — Loudness meter replaces the plasma playhead

**Decision:** The playhead visualization is CQT bins as bars in a bordered 2:1 rect; its width is later derived from the solved runway geometry so its edges sit on the rails (#461).
**Why:** The plasma beam (beat detection, spark particles, tendrils) traded simplicity away and its particle internals were untestable (flagged in #365). Deliberate spectacle→simplicity trade.
**Source:** PRs #417, #418.

## 2026-03-12 — Inverted scroll math, not a CSS mirror flip

**Decision:** Time 0 lives at the *bottom* of the scroll area (`scrollTop = maxScrollTop − time × pps`), with `perspective-origin: center bottom` and `align-items: end` on the timeline grid.
**Why:** The alternative — top-down DOM rendering plus `scaleY(-1)` on the container (#381, eliminating 11 inversion points) — inverts the `rotateX` direction and fought every perspective tuning; #401 reverted it. `align-items: end` fixes the track-placement bug that motivated the flip. Don't reintroduce a mirror flip.
**Source:** PRs #375, #381, #401.

## 2026-03-11 — Runway look from `perspective + rotateX` only; scaleX narrowing rejected

**Decision:** No scale-based narrowing in the runway transform.
**Why:** A `scaleX(0.16)` + 85° tilt build (#395, unmerged) made hit-testing and `getBoundingClientRect` fundamentally unreliable — tests had to be deleted; #397 achieved the look while keeping every test. The same thread documented cross-browser interop problems with `overflow` on perspective containers (CSSWG #8193/#9458): keep overflow on a separate wrapper (foreshadowed the #459 clipping bug).
**Source:** PRs #395, #397.

## 2026-03-09 — Basic Pitch replaces MELODIA for melody extraction

**Decision:** Melody extraction uses Spotify Basic Pitch (TF.js, 22.05 kHz, model self-hosted in `public/basic-pitch-model/`); essentia.js remains only for the classification mel spectrogram.
**Why:** essentia's `PredominantPitchMelodia` is monophonic DSP tuned for vocals — chords collapsed to one note, real-world recordings gave mediocre contours. Basic Pitch is polyphonic and instrument-agnostic, and adds pitch-bend data (a path to MIDI export, #182). The swap stayed contained to `MelodyExtractor` because downstream consumes the stable `MelodyNote[]` types.
**Source:** PRs #306 (MELODIA), #354/#355 (replacement).

## 2026-03-08 — Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui + Vaul replace Ant Design

**Decision:** UI stack is Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (owned source) + Vaul bottom sheets; Sonner replaced the message API, Lucide replaced `@ant-design/icons`.
**Why:** Research compared six libraries on mobile-native criteria. AntD lost on enterprise aesthetic, no snap-point bottom sheet, CSS-in-JS runtime cost, and its v5 static `message` API rendering outside the React tree (dark theme never applied to toasts, #247). Mantine was runner-up; MUI rejected (heaviest). Migration ran incrementally with Tailwind coexisting beside AntD via `@layer` until final removal.
**Source:** Issue #282, PRs #283 (research), #296–#333.

## 2026-03-07 — Essentia.js + Discogs-EffNet classification, after four failed model swaps

**Decision:** Instrument classification is a purpose-built supervised pipeline: essentia WASM mel spectrogram → Discogs-EffNet embeddings → MTG-Jamendo instrument head (~21 MB total vs 205 MB CLAP).
**Why:** The failures: `Xenova/clap-large` was deleted from HuggingFace hosting and 401'd in production (#244); AST/AudioSet returns broad event labels useless on isolated stems (#249); CLAP zero-shot, loudest-segment CLAP, and music-trained CLAP each labeled *every* stem "singing vocals" (#250, #261, #266); filename-keyword classification was built and rejected before merge — recordings have no filename and users don't name files by instrument (#259, #261). Lesson: for a narrow classification task, a small supervised head beat every general-purpose/zero-shot model tried.
**Source:** Issue #176; PRs #244–#269.

## 2026-03-06 — Model downloads proxied through same origin

**Decision:** Model URLs use app-relative `/models/*`, proxied by the Vite dev server in development and a Netlify redirect (`/models/* → essentia.upf.edu/models/:splat`) in production.
**Why:** essentia.upf.edu serves no CORS headers, so direct browser `fetch()` fails. Anyone changing model hosting must preserve the indirection.
**Source:** PR #270; `netlify.toml`.

## 2026-03 — IndexedDB: separate stores; storage failures degrade, never wedge

**Decision:** `ProjectStorageService` uses separate object stores (`projects`, `audioData`, `spectrograms`; later melodies v2, transcriptions v3) so metadata lists load without pulling audio, with `idb` for async/await and upgrade management (design: issue #237).
**Why (rules from shipped bugs):** a cached *rejected* `openDB` promise permanently wedged storage for the session — the promise cache must reset on rejection and handle `blocked` (multi-tab; relevant on every `DB_VERSION` bump) (#342). IndexedDB can be wholly unavailable (private browsing) — reads must try/catch/finally into an empty-state render, never a stuck loading state (#311).
**Source:** Issue #237; PRs #241–#246, #311, #342.

## 2026-03-03 — Services own Tone.js; the relay-hook layer was removed

**Decision:** The current architecture — services encapsulate Tone.js, private signals with plain getters plus a `signals` accessor, bridge hooks, workflows coordinate — was fixed in #200–#208.
**Why:** An earlier design had signal-to-signal relay hooks (`useTransportBridge` etc.) translating service signals into engine commands; it was deleted because reactive chains (signal → effect → service → effect) add indirection when the trigger is already a known workflow. Don't reintroduce relay layers as "decoupling". The Q1 migration introduced signals; these PRs defined their ownership discipline.
**Source:** PRs #200, #202–#208.

## 2026-03-03 — AudioWorklet PCM capture for recording; MediaRecorder rejected

**Decision:** `WorkletRecorder` captures raw PCM in an AudioWorklet; `Tone.Recorder` is only the silent fallback — both stop-recording branches must stay maintained.
**Why:** MediaRecorder-based paths are structurally unfit for overdubbing: no sample-accurate timing, unpredictable silence trimming, encoding delay; a `MediaStreamDestination` mix loses track separation; `Tone.Offline` can't capture a live mic. Low-latency mic constraints require bypassing `Tone.UserMedia.open()` (see kb/domain.md, Audio engine).
**Source:** PR #123 (research), #209, #210, #219.

## 2026-02-23 — CI runs e2e on PRs only; Netlify deploys itself

**Decision:** No deploy job in GitHub Actions; e2e restricted to `pull_request` events.
**Why:** A deploy-to-Netlify job (#115) was removed the next day (#120): Netlify's own build integration deploys master, and PR-only e2e saves CI minutes. The final state is intentional, not forgotten deployment.
**Source:** PRs #115, #120.

## 2026-02-22 — Undo/redo: command history over project mutations only

**Decision:** `useUndoReducer` records reverse actions computed from *pre-mutation* state; workstation UI state is deliberately separate so view toggles can never be "undone"; `AudioSourceRepository` buffers are intentionally never disposed in-session, so undo-delete restores a track without re-decoding.
**Why:** The non-disposal especially reads as a leak to a future reader — it is a cache.
**Source:** PR #110.

## 2026-02-22 — React Compiler removed; `useSignals()` is the reactivity mechanism

**Decision:** `babel-plugin-react-compiler` is not wired into the build (the devDep lingers unwired in `package.json` — removal candidate). Every component/hook that reads signals during render calls `useSignals()` — the reason bridge hooks exist in their current form.
**Why:** The compiler's auto-memoization caches signal reads and breaks `@preact/signals-react` v3 reactivity; the library requires either its Babel transform or explicit `useSignals()`. Enabling the compiler reintroduces the #114 failure class: audio engine responds, UI silently frozen.
**Source:** PRs #103 (enabled), #114 (root-caused and removed).

## 2026-02-22 — Signals-based service layer

**Decision:** Service state lives in `@preact/signals-react` signals with single-owner semantics, bridge hooks translating to React, and services as state machines.
**Why:** Decouples the audio engine's state from React render cycles; gives tests synchronous plain-getter access; makes ownership auditable. Seeded by research issue #100, planned as 8 independently-deployable phases (`MIGRATION.md`, PR #102), executed one PR per phase in a day, then regression-cleaned in #114 (lesson: kb/verification.md). Ownership discipline was finalized later in #200–#208 (see above). Full rules: CLAUDE.md ("Design Principles").
**Source:** `FUTURE_PLANS.md` ("Signal-Synced Architecture"), issue #100, PRs #102–#111, #114.

## 2026-02-18 — Modernization stack: Vite; npm and Netlify kept

**Decision:** CRA → Vite; npm and Netlify retained.
**Why:** A client-side audio app with no SSR needs → Vite over Next.js/Remix; npm for single-repo simplicity; a static SPA gains nothing from leaving Netlify. The forcing blocker for the whole migration was `react-beautiful-dnd` (unmaintained, React 18-incompatible) → replaced with @dnd-kit.
**Source:** PRs #76 (plan), #77 (execution).
